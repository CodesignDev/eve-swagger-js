# Eve Swagger Interface

## An OpenAPI for EVE Online

JavaScript client for [ESI](https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/introducing-the-esi-api) compatible with NodeJS.
The client returns a developer friendly set of functions that return promises resolving to the response from ESI endpoint.
The underlying client library is generated by [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).
