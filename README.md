# Eve Swagger Interface

## An OpenAPI for EVE Online

JavaScript client for [ESI](https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/introducing-the-esi-api) compatible with NodeJS.
The client returns a developer friendly set of functions that return promises resolving to the response from ESI endpoint.
The underlying client library is generated by [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).
Its documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/lhkbob/eve-swagger-js/blob/master/generated/README.md), which is primarily useful for details on the response data models.

Currently, this library has not been published to the `npm` repository.
However, it can still be depended on in NodeJS projects by including a dependency in `package.json` using a GitHub URL.
A specific release can be requested by appending, e.g. `#0.1.3`, to the end of the URL:

```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
// The main module returns a factory function that takes optional
// options, all of which are shown below with their default values.
var ESI = require('eve_swagger_interface')({
    accessToken: null,
    datasource: 'tranquility',
    language: 'en',
    baseURL: 'https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest',
  });

ESI.alliance.getAll().then(function(alliances) {

});
```
