# Eve Swagger Interface

## An OpenAPI for EVE Online

JavaScript client for [ESI](https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/introducing-the-esi-api) compatible with NodeJS.
The client returns a developer friendly set of functions that return promises resolving to the response from ESI endpoint.
The underlying client library is generated by [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).
Its documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/lhkbob/eve-swagger-js/blob/master/generated/README.md), which is primarily useful for details on the response data models.
Versioning will follow the version reported by ESI as best as possible.

- Package version: 0.3.2
