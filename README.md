However, it can still be depended on in NodeJS projects by including a dependency in `package.json` using a GitHub URL.
A specific release can be requested by appending, e.g. `#0.1.3`, to the end of the URL:

}
```

```javascript
// The main module returns a factory function that takes optional
// options, all of which are shown below with their default values.

    accessToken: null,
    datasource: 'tranquility',
    language: 'en',
